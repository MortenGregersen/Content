This is a code-along. The sample project includes both the starting point and how the project should look after the session.

Download the sample project here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Building-a-document-based-app-using-SwiftData

## @Observable

- Set up data flow with less code
- Automatic dependencies
- Seamlessly bind models' mutable state to UI

*See more in the session "Discover Observation with SwiftUI".*

## @Query (Property wrapper)

```swift
@Query(sort: \.created) private var cards: [Card]
```

- Provides the view with data
- Triggers view update on every change of the models
- A view can have multiple `@Query` properties
- Uses `ModelContext` as the source of data

`@Query` needs a model context for it to work. We get the model context from the model container.

## modelContainer (View modifier)

```swift
.modelContainer(for: Card.self)
```

- Sets up the model container
- Creates the storage stack
- A view has a single model container

An app needs to set up at least one model container. Model containers are inherited in by the views (like `.environment()`). Different windows (or views inside windows) can have different model containers.

## modelContext (Environment variable)

```swift
@Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext
```

- Provides access to the model context
- A view has a single model context

Like the model container, a view has a single context, but a application can have multiple.

> This environment variable was populated automatically when we set the model container earlier.

About saving the context:

> You might think that after inserting the model, you need to save the context, calling `modelContext.save()`, but you don't need to do that. A nice detail about SwiftData is that it autosaves the model context. The autosaves are triggered by UI-related events and user input. We donâ€™t need to worry about saving because SwiftData does it for us. There are only a few cases when you want to make sure that all the changes are persisted immediately, for example, before sharing the SwiftData storage or sending it over. In these cases, call `save()` explicitly.

## DocumentGroup

On iOS and macOS instead of the `WindowGroup` we can use the `DocumentGroup`. This makes the app a document based app.

- You have to set up a custom `contentType`/file format for your documents.
- The content type has to be set up in Info.plist with the same identifier as you use in code.
- The content type set up in Info.plist needs to conform to `com.apple.package`.
- You should NOT set up an `.modelContainer` for the `DocumentGroup`, as it does it automatically.
